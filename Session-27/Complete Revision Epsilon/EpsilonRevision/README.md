The following repository is a build from the ground up of 
a functional Hospital management System. 

It is made step by step by using the following structure :

1) A Class library containing all the models 
2) A Class library that contains the EF configurations and the dbContext functionality
3) Razor Pages MVC for the frontend 
4) Blazor WebAssembly App used for the frontend
5) Optionally a Windows Forms application. 

C# all the way
